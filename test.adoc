== Kubernetes Patterns - Examples

This GitHub project contains the examples from the "Kubernetes Patterns" book by https://github.com/bibryam[Bilgin Ibryam] and [Roland Hu√ü](https://github.com/rhuss) (_to be announced soon_)

Installation instructions for the examples' prerequisites are summarized in [INSTALL](INSTALL.adoc).
By default, you just need access to a vanilla Kubernetes installation, like Minikube.
If addons are required, the example description explains this additional requirement.

For feedback, issues or questions in general, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bibryam/k8spatterns/issues) to open issues.
Also we love contributions like spelling fixes, bug fixes, improvements, ... Please open Pull Requests, we are happy to review them !
