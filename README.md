# Kubernetes Patterns - Examples

This GitHub project contains the examples from the [Kubernetes Patterns](https://leanpub.com/k8spatterns) book by [Bilgin Ibryam](https://github.com/bibryam) and [Roland Hu√ü](https://github.com/rhuss). 
Each of the examples is contained in an extra directory and is self contained.

[minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) is recommended not only for trying out theses examples but also for an easy and simple to use Kubernetes setup in general.

For feedback, issues or questions in general, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bibryam/k8spatterns/issues) to open issues.
